# TypeScript Node Harness

Created: 2026-07-10

This document prepares for future implementation. It is not implementation scaffolding.

When Vault Desk moves from documentation to code, Vault Core and the local orchestration layer should be TypeScript running on Node.js. The Tauri v2 desktop host is the narrow exception: it contains only the minimum Rust needed for the native shell and sidecar boundary.

## Scope Of The Harness

The TypeScript/Node harness should eventually own:

- Local API.
- Session orchestration.
- Workspace state.
- Job queue coordination.
- Resumable folder job manifests.
- Tool registry.
- Policy checks.
- Approval flow.
- Model runtime adapters.
- Document pipeline orchestration.
- Retrieval orchestration.
- Summary tree orchestration.
- Claim verification orchestration.
- Context compaction orchestration.
- Audit events.
- Export coordination.
- Diagnostics.
- Schema-versioned workspace migrations.
- Worker supervision and resource scheduling.
- MicroVM lifecycle and guest-image verification.
- Typed external-connection brokering.
- Deterministic document query and transformation routing.
- Bounded code-interpreter job orchestration and audit.

The harness should not directly become:

- A model runtime.
- An OCR engine.
- A vector database implementation.
- A UI framework.
- A privileged shell bridge.
- A general-purpose coding environment.

Those should be adapters, services, or tools behind typed boundaries.

## Sandbox Boundary

The harness coordinates a platform sandbox launcher behind one contract. Hostile document parsing and future executable tools run in disposable, job-scoped microVMs with no virtual network device. The launcher must not approximate network isolation by matching commands, executables, URLs, domains, addresses, or protocols.

The common microVM contract provides:

- A verified immutable guest image.
- Job-scoped read-only input storage or bounded byte streams.
- Bounded ephemeral scratch storage.
- Versioned typed IPC over virtio-socket, Hyper-V socket, or the platform-equivalent host/guest channel.
- CPU, memory, time, storage, output-size, concurrency, cancellation, and termination controls.
- Configuration evidence that no virtual network adapter or general host-network proxy exists.

Research-derived platform targets are Apple Containerization or Virtualization.framework on macOS 26 Apple silicon, HCS/Hyper-V on supported Windows editions, and Firecracker/KVM when Linux desktop certification opens. M0 must validate exact APIs, packaging, edition requirements, licensing, and lifecycle behavior before implementation choices are locked.

Vault Core exposes no generic network service to the guest. Explicit external integrations use a separate typed broker that owns credentials, policy, approval, destination validation, limits, and audit. The broker cannot be invoked as an arbitrary fetch or forwarding service.

Hardware-accelerated inference remains host-native for the first runtime so Metal, CUDA, HIP, and Vulkan remain available. The inference process is supervised and OS-sandboxed, has no shell or executable tools, and receives no network capability, credentials, arbitrary workspace paths, or approval authority. This is a narrow accelerator exception, not an alternative hostile-work sandbox. See [adr/0012-worker-isolation-and-untrusted-documents.md](adr/0012-worker-isolation-and-untrusted-documents.md).

Generated code uses a separate immutable guest role under the same no-NIC microVM contract. Each job receives explicit read-only inputs, pinned offline interpreters and libraries, bounded scratch space, and a typed result schema. The guest cannot install dependencies or connect to a general model server. Vault Core mediates bounded completion requests over typed host/guest IPC, records the code and execution trace, validates results, and destroys the guest after the job. See [adr/0015-deterministic-document-tools-and-code-fallback.md](adr/0015-deterministic-document-tools-and-code-fallback.md).

## Local Process Boundary

Vault Core should run as a separate packaged sidecar process from the Tauri shell from the first implementation milestone. The versioned local JSON-RPC protocol uses a Unix domain socket on macOS and a named pipe on Windows behind one transport contract. TCP is not part of the desktop boundary.

The React webview calls only narrow typed Tauri commands. The minimal Rust host owns native window/dialog integration, validates its command surface, starts and verifies the exact Vault Core sidecar, and bootstraps the local connection. It owns no product workflow or policy.

The protocol must include request and job IDs, idempotency keys for mutations, cancellation, bounded streaming, backpressure, reconnect behavior, version negotiation, and structured errors. Unit tests may call the core API directly, but every milestone must also exercise new backend behavior through the daemon. See [adr/0010-electron-and-local-transport.md](adr/0010-electron-and-local-transport.md) and [adr/0014-tauri-desktop-shell.md](adr/0014-tauri-desktop-shell.md).

## Workspace State Principle

Authoritative workspace state, immutable artifacts, and derived indexes must be distinguishable by construction.

- A transactional, schema-versioned catalog owns jobs, manifests, sessions, approvals, evidence references, verification results, and migrations.
- Canonical documents and evidence artifacts are content-addressed and written atomically.
- LanceDB indexes, embeddings, summaries, and caches are rebuildable derived state.
- A single-writer lock, idempotent mutations, durable resume cursors, backup-before-migrate, and explicit cleanup protect recovery.
- Routine audit records avoid copying raw sensitive content when hashes, structured metadata, redacted previews, and artifact references are sufficient.

See [adr/0011-workspace-state-and-recovery.md](adr/0011-workspace-state-and-recovery.md).

## Why TypeScript Under Node

TypeScript under Node is the planned baseline because it gives:

- Strong typing for tool schemas and policy decisions.
- A product backend that remains independent from the Tauri webview and thin Rust host.
- Mature local API patterns.
- Straightforward streaming support.
- Broad ecosystem support for document, filesystem, worker, and observability integration.
- Easier cross-platform packaging than a server-only stack.

## Future Package Direction

Do not create packages yet.

When code begins, likely logical package boundaries include:

- Tauri desktop shell: React/TypeScript frontend plus minimal Rust host.
- Local API.
- Orchestrator.
- Tool registry.
- Policy engine.
- Audit events.
- Runtime adapters.
- Document adapters.
- Workflow definitions.
- Document-set manifests.
- Parser adapter contracts.
- Retrieval adapter contracts.
- Verifier contracts.
- Shared types.
- Test fixtures and evaluation harness.

These are logical boundaries only. They should be revisited before scaffolding.

## Runtime Adapter Principle

The Node harness should call local inference runtimes through stable adapter interfaces rather than embedding one vendor runtime deeply into the product.

Candidate adapter families (support status verified 2026-07-11; see [research/local-ai-runtimes.md](research/local-ai-runtimes.md)):

- node-llama-cpp (MIT) as the first supervised inference-worker adapter: loads Gemma 4 QAT GGUFs, enforces JSON-schema output via grammar-constrained sampling, and supports function calling, embeddings, reranking, and speculative decoding, with Metal, CUDA, and Vulkan builds. It runs behind Vault Core rather than inside the Tauri webview or Rust host.
- A supervised llama-server child process as the companion adapter for vision workloads (Gemma 4 multimodal, PaddleOCR-VL, Granite-Docling GGUF), because node-llama-cpp does not yet support image input.
- MLX-family local serving on macOS.
- Ollama-compatible serving.
- Google LiteRT-LM's OpenAI-compatible local server as an emerging Google-first adapter to track.
- vLLM-compatible serving for appliances or stronger local servers.
- Hosted fallback adapters only when explicitly enabled.

ONNX Runtime GenAI has no official Node.js bindings as of July 2026 and is not a candidate primary runtime.

The first Windows and macOS certification uses node-llama-cpp and the pinned official QAT GGUF. MLX-family serving remains a later adapter-backed optimization rather than a parallel first implementation. See [adr/0013-first-desktop-runtime.md](adr/0013-first-desktop-runtime.md).

The first certified adapters should be evaluated against the Local 12 and Local 16 Gemma 4 12B QAT profiles documented in [MODEL_STRATEGY.md](MODEL_STRATEGY.md) and [PERFORMANCE_AND_CONTEXT.md](PERFORMANCE_AND_CONTEXT.md).

## Structured Output Principle

Structured output from local models must be enforced at the sampler, not requested in the prompt. llama.cpp converts JSON Schema to GBNF grammar and masks invalid tokens, making malformed JSON mechanically impossible. The harness should:

- Define every tool and extraction schema once, in TypeScript (Zod or equivalent), and derive both the grammar and the validator from it.
- Also describe the schema in the prompt, because the grammar is not visible to the model.
- Keep validate-and-retry as a semantic backstop for content that is syntactically valid but wrong.
- Track first-attempt schema validity as a benchmark metric.

## Document Pipeline Principle

The Node harness should coordinate document processing without becoming the parser itself.

Planned adapter categories (tool choices verified 2026-07-11; see [research/document-tools-2026.md](research/document-tools-2026.md)):

- Native Node adapters for born-digital files: pdf.js text layer, mammoth for DOCX, ExcelJS or SheetJS for spreadsheets, officeParser, and mailparser. These run in microVM document workers and cover most files without a heavy Python pipeline.
- Granite-Docling GGUF adapter for layout-aware PDFs and complex documents, served by the same llama.cpp runtime family as Gemma.
- PaddleOCR-VL adapter for scanned pages and low-confidence extraction, also served under llama.cpp.
- One Python document-worker image hosting the remaining Python parsers (Docling full pipeline, MarkItDown, Unstructured) inside the same no-NIC microVM boundary, packaged without exposing Python dependencies to Vault Core.
- Native spreadsheet adapter for XLSX, XLS, CSV, formulas, sheets, rows, and cells.
- Gemma multimodal inspection adapter for ambiguous page regions.

Worker rule: document parsing and executable tools run inside the no-NIC microVM boundary with typed host/guest IPC, resource limits, cancellation, and staged inputs. Host-native GPU workers use the narrower OS-enforced accelerator exception and cannot execute tools or access networks. At most one Python worker image may host later Python parser fallbacks. See [adr/0012-worker-isolation-and-untrusted-documents.md](adr/0012-worker-isolation-and-untrusted-documents.md).

The harness should persist a document-set manifest so huge folder jobs can resume after failure.

## Hybrid Execution Principle

Do not use model-generated scripts for common supported document work. Vault Core should expose typed deterministic operations over canonical documents for exact search, filtering, sorting, joins, comparisons, aggregation, arithmetic, extraction, and export. A folder-wide XLSX search must operate over preserved sheet/cell data and return exact anchors without invoking the model or code interpreter.

Only a request that cannot be expressed through supported operations may be routed by policy to the bounded code-interpreter microVM. Generated code is untrusted input to the verifier, not product authority. Its source, environment, inputs, outputs, logs, resource use, and termination are auditable, and any workspace write or export still crosses normal policy and approval boundaries.

OpenCode may be benchmarked against a minimal Vault Desk-owned guest loop. It is adopted only if it passes the same offline, no-NIC, typed-inference, cancellation, audit, result-schema, footprint, and packaging gates while reducing maintained code.

## Agent Loop Principle

The first accounting workflow should be an explicit, inspectable workflow rather than a generic agent loop. Deterministic document tools precede iterative model/tool use. Where bounded iterative read-tool use is needed, prefer a maintained framework only if it preserves the approval boundary and reduces code. Verified 2026-07-11: Vercel AI SDK 6 (Apache 2.0) is the primary candidate because its tool loop supports per-tool approval gating, typed tool schemas, and streaming. The fallback is a thin loop over the runtime adapter.

Framework rule: policy checks, approval decisions, audit events, and rollback stay in Vault Desk code behind the tool registry contract. The framework only drives the propose-approve-execute-observe cycle; it must not own policy.

Audit shape: structure trace records after the OpenTelemetry GenAI semantic conventions (agent invocation, model call, tool execution span tree), persisted to a local append-only audit log with content hashes so sessions are replayable, while noting those conventions are still pre-stability and must be version-pinned.

## Retrieval And Verification Principle

The harness should coordinate:

- EmbeddingGemma indexing (via node-llama-cpp GGUF embeddings or the Transformers.js ONNX path).
- Lexical indexing.
- An embedded hybrid index (LanceDB is the verified primary candidate: in-process for Node, hybrid lexical-plus-dense search, binary quantization), with TurboQuant-based acceleration only if benchmarks justify it. See [RETRIEVAL_AND_VERIFICATION.md](RETRIEVAL_AND_VERIFICATION.md).
- Evidence pack assembly.
- Claim parsing.
- Citation checks.
- Deterministic spreadsheet and arithmetic checks.
- Contradiction search.
- Human review queues.

The verifier must be a separate workflow stage. It must not rely on a single "please verify" model prompt as proof of correctness.

## Context Compaction Principle

The harness should treat model context as a temporary working set, not durable application memory.

The harness should persist:

- Session summary.
- Task ledger.
- Evidence ledger.
- Artifact ledger.
- Preference ledger.
- Warning ledger.
- Compaction events.

Compaction should be triggered before active context pressure causes quality loss. Compacted state must be structured, inspectable, auditable, and safe to replay. It must not preserve hidden model reasoning.

## Tool Registry Principle

Every tool should have:

- A name.
- A version.
- A typed input schema.
- A typed output schema.
- Required permissions.
- Preview behavior.
- Approval behavior.
- Resource limits.
- Audit behavior.
- Rollback behavior when applicable.

The model can request a tool. The harness decides whether it is valid, allowed, previewed, approved, executed, logged, or rejected.

## Testing Direction

Future tests should cover:

- Policy decisions.
- Path scope enforcement.
- Tool schema validation.
- Approval flow.
- Audit event creation.
- Document pipeline routing.
- Retrieval reproducibility.
- Summary tree invalidation.
- Claim verification.
- Compaction state preservation.
- Export correctness.
- Runtime adapter failure handling.
- Offline mode.
- Workspace migration and crash recovery.
- Cross-platform daemon lifecycle and protocol compatibility.
- MicroVM lifecycle, zero-network-device configuration, typed socket confinement, resource limits, and hostile-document handling.
- Native accelerator OS-sandbox and network-capability denial.
- Tauri capability denial, sidecar identity, local-protocol bootstrap, platform-webview behavior, and packaged lifecycle.
- Deterministic-operation routing and exact folder-wide spreadsheet search without model use.
- Generated-code isolation, typed inference mediation, resource exhaustion, result verification, and audit replay.

See [IMPLEMENTATION_QUALITY_BAR.md](IMPLEMENTATION_QUALITY_BAR.md) for the minimal-code and minimal-test policy.

## No-Code Constraint

Do not add:

- package.json.
- tsconfig.json.
- source directories.
- test files.
- scripts.
- lockfiles.
- generated templates.

Those belong to a future implementation phase. The step-by-step plan for that phase is [IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md](IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md); its milestone M0 is what formally lifts this constraint.
