# Open Source Boundary

Created: 2026-07-10

Vault Desk should use a useful open-source community application to create trust, distribution, product feedback, and demand for supported deployments.

The community product must be real software, not a crippled demo.

## Community Candidate Modules

Likely open-source:

- Desktop application shell.
- Local single-user workspace.
- Local document ingestion.
- Deterministic canonical-document search, filtering, comparison, calculation, and extraction.
- Bounded no-NIC code-interpreter fallback and its audit surface.
- Local search and retrieval.
- Local model/runtime adapter interface.
- Safe folder access.
- Basic tool registry.
- Local Knowledge Bundle reader, verifier, catalog, and rebuildable indexing.
- Approval UI for local actions.
- Export workflows.
- Hardware compatibility check.
- Community documentation.

## Business Candidate Modules

Likely proprietary:

- Organization management.
- Multi-user administration.
- Identity integration.
- Role and policy engine.
- Permission-aware retrieval across shared workspaces.
- Approval workflows for teams.
- Immutable audit trail.
- Backup orchestration.
- Appliance and fleet management.
- Long-term supported release channels.
- Curated and supported professional Knowledge Bundle channels, delegated publisher roots, and organization-local bundle governance.
- Business integrations.
- Administration dashboard.
- Diagnostics and support tooling.
- Support SLA enforcement.

## Boundary Principles

- The community product must remain independently useful.
- Business controls should not contaminate the community core with hard-coded limitations.
- Shared abstractions should be designed once and used by both desktop and office editions.
- Proprietary modules should add governance, scale, supportability, and integrations.
- The user should not need to understand which module handles a task.

## Licensing Decisions

Resolved decisions:

- Community source license: Apache License 2.0, selected by the repository owner on 2026-07-15. The root `LICENSE` file was added when M0 began, per [IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md](IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md). Rationale: explicit patent grant over MIT, no CLA needed alongside the DCO-only contribution rule, compatible with the open-core boundary in this document, and matching Gemma 4, llama.cpp, and node-llama-cpp licensing. The permissive norm in the adjacent space (AnythingLLM, Hermes, OpenClaw, OpenCode, Onyx community on MIT; Jan on Apache 2.0) and the Open WebUI custom-license backlash both informed the choice.
- Contributor agreement strategy: Developer Certificate of Origin 1.1 sign-off with no CLA, per [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md).
- Compliance ownership: the repository owner is responsible for dependency, model, notice, and redistribution approval decisions until a second maintainer is appointed and this line is updated.
- Model and third-party notice strategy: manifest-driven `development` / `candidate_to_ship` / `ships` status with packaged notices, SBOMs, and inventories, per [IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md](IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md).

Open decisions:

- Trademark policy.
- Whether business plugins can depend on community extension points.

Known model-license facts (verified 2026-07-11):

- Gemma 4 (including 12B QAT) is Apache 2.0. It can be redistributed inside community packaging with standard notices.
- Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B, the default encoder per [ADR 0016](adr/0016-model-agnostic-defaults-and-managed-downloads.md), is Apache 2.0 with an official GGUF release, so the default shipped stack is fully Apache 2.0.
- EmbeddingGemma (validated alternative encoder) remains under the Gemma Terms of Use, not Apache 2.0. Redistribution and bundling terms need explicit review before it could ship inside any installer.
- Candidate third-party components are permissively licensed: turbovec (MIT), Docling (MIT), MarkItDown (MIT), llama.cpp and node-llama-cpp (MIT).

Implementation consequence: every model and native runtime begins as a development or candidate-to-ship asset. A candidate can be marked as shipping only after redistribution terms, required notices, platform package behavior, hashes, and offline operation are reviewed. Packaging must emit third-party notices plus dependency and model inventories.

The same gate applies resource by resource to Knowledge Bundles. Public access does not establish copyright, database-rights, modification, or commercial redistribution permission. Each distributed bundle needs declared and concluded licenses, attribution, provenance, intended-use, review ownership, and a recorded redistribution decision. Locally built private bundles may reference lawfully obtained materials that Vault Desk itself is not permitted to redistribute.

## Intellectual Property Hygiene

This repository should contain:

- Original Vault Desk concepts.
- Public market knowledge.
- Public prior-art summaries.
- Architecture hypotheses.
- Future product decisions.

This repository should not contain:

- Employer code.
- Employer confidential information.
- Employer internal architecture.
- Employer-owned generated assets.
- Third-party proprietary source.
- Unlicensed copied documentation.

## Revision History

| Date | Change |
|---|---|
| 2026-07-10 | Initial open-source boundary document created from supplied concept material. |
| 2026-07-11 | Added verified model and component license facts: Gemma 4 Apache 2.0, EmbeddingGemma Gemma Terms of Use caveat, and permissive licenses for candidate components. |
| 2026-07-11 | Added the candidate-to-ship review gate and package notice/inventory requirements. |
| 2026-07-12 | Added community and business Knowledge Bundle boundaries plus resource-level content-rights review. |
| 2026-07-13 | Added deterministic document operations and the bounded code-interpreter fallback to the community candidate surface. |
| 2026-07-15 | Recorded the owner-selected Apache 2.0 community license, DCO-only contributor strategy, compliance ownership, and manifest-driven notice strategy; narrowed open decisions to trademark policy and business-plugin extension points. |
