# M3 Agent Guest Dependency Review

Date: 2026-07-20

Decision: approved for the macOS M3 guest image only. The image uses the smallest fixed offline set that covers the named V1 tasks: Python and Node execution, JSON/CSV/SQLite from the standard library, and common PDF, DOCX, XLSX, and image inspection. It contains no pip, npm, Corepack, package-install configuration, or runtime network path.

Primary package records are the official [Node.js release archive](https://nodejs.org/download/release/v24.18.0/), [pypdf project](https://pypi.org/project/pypdf/6.14.2/), [openpyxl project](https://pypi.org/project/openpyxl/3.1.5/), and [python-docx project](https://pypi.org/project/python-docx/1.2.0/). Exact downloaded filenames and hashes are enforced by the Buildroot package hash files; the complete shipped set is recorded in `packages/workers/images/agent/manifest.json`.

## Boundary and maintenance decision

- These packages execute only inside the session-scoped no-NIC guest as an unprivileged user over a live read-only source mount, immutable attachments, and a bounded persistent tmpfs workspace.
- XML hardening remains enabled through `defusedxml`; document results are untrusted artifacts until Core validates their protocol, count, size, and content hash.
- Runtime installation and arbitrary user packages are unsupported. A new library requires a new dependency review, exact pin, license update, reproducibility pass, and physical isolation gate.
- Generated images and downloaded wheels remain ignored. Distribution carries the guest manifest, third-party notices, SPDX SBOM, and resource hashes.
