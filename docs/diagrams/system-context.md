## Notes

- Hosted escalation is not a default dependency.
- Remote support is not a default access path.
- The selected folder remains local, live, and read-only to the guest; the bounded session workspace is private Vault Desk state.
- Agent-authored code has no virtual network device; approved future external connections use the separate broker.
