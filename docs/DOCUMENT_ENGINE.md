# Document Engine

Created: 2026-07-10

Vault Desk must work on folders containing tens of huge documents, including PDFs, Word documents, Excel workbooks, CSVs, images, emails, and mixed client folders.

The document engine should be deterministic, resumable, evidence-preserving, and independent from the model runtime. Generated code is a bounded fallback for novel transformations, not the normal way to read supported formats.

## Core Principle

Do not ask the model to read the folder.

The system should build a durable document corpus first, then ask Gemma-family models to reason over selected, cited evidence.

This is especially important for Local 12 and Local 16. Gemma 4 12B QAT should receive evidence packs, not raw folders.

## Folder Job Lifecycle

1. Inventory files.
2. Hash files and detect duplicates.
3. Create a document-set manifest.
4. Detect file types and container structure.
5. Route files through the best extraction path.
6. Normalize outputs into canonical document objects.
7. Record parser, confidence, page, table, sheet, row, cell, and region metadata.
8. Build deterministic query views, summaries, and indexes.
9. Execute supported searches, filters, joins, comparisons, and calculations through typed tools.
10. Run task-specific retrieval.
11. Route only unsupported transformations to the bounded code interpreter.
12. Generate structured outputs.
13. Verify claims, calculations, code-produced results, and citations.
14. Export only after approval.

Every job should be resumable after crash, restart, or low-memory failure.

## Canonical Document Object

Every ingested document should normalize into a representation with:

- Stable document ID.
- Original file path.
- Content hash.
- File version.
- Parser name and version.
- Extraction timestamp.
- Pages.
- Sections.
- Paragraphs.
- Tables.
- Cells.
- Figures.
- Images.
- OCR regions.
- Spreadsheet sheets.
- Spreadsheet formulas.
- CSV row and column coordinates.
- Source anchors.
- Confidence scores.
- Warnings.

The canonical object is the source for summaries, embeddings, citations, exports, and verification.

## Tooling Strategy

Use a layered parser strategy rather than one universal converter. Roles below were revalidated against live sources on 2026-07-11; see [research/document-tools-2026.md](research/document-tools-2026.md) for licenses and benchmarks.

| Tool | Recommended role | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Native Node parsers (pdf.js text layer, mammoth, ExcelJS/SheetJS, officeParser, mailparser) | Born-digital PDFs, DOCX, XLSX, CSV, and email in no-NIC microVM document workers | Permissively licensed; covers most files without the heavy Python pipeline while placing hostile inputs behind a VM boundary |
| Granite-Docling-258M (GGUF under llama.cpp) | Layout-aware page-image-to-DocTags conversion for high-value PDFs, tables, and reading order | Apache 2.0; runs through the same llama.cpp runtime family as Gemma, avoiding a Python dependency |
| Docling (Python sidecar) | Full-pipeline layout-aware conversion when the GGUF path is insufficient | MIT; preferred for the hardest legal and accounting layouts |
| PaddleOCR-VL (GGUF under llama.cpp) | Primary OCR for scanned pages and image-only PDFs | Apache 2.0; ~3 GB; specialized document VLM, ahead of classical OCR pipelines on business scans |
| Microsoft MarkItDown (Python sidecar) | Broad first-pass conversion of remaining formats | Good first-pass layer; never the sole parser for tables or citations |
| Unstructured (Python sidecar) | Partition fallback and parser-disagreement comparison | Strategy levels drive low-confidence warnings |
| Gemma 4 multimodal inspection | Ambiguous page regions, charts, forms, handwriting, or extraction conflicts | Escalation and cross-check path, not primary parsing or transcription |

Delivery rule: native Node and Python parsers run inside the same certified no-NIC microVM boundary, using separate minimal worker images only where their dependencies require it. The guest receives capability-scoped read-only inputs, bounded scratch storage, typed host/guest IPC, resource limits, and cancellation. It has no virtual network adapter or general proxy, and network denial is never implemented by matching commands or destinations. GPU-backed OCR and layout runtimes may use the documented native accelerator exception when microVM execution would lose required acceleration. See [adr/0012-worker-isolation-and-untrusted-documents.md](adr/0012-worker-isolation-and-untrusted-documents.md).

## Deterministic Operations And Code Fallback

Canonical documents expose typed product operations for exact search, filter, sort, join, comparison, aggregation, arithmetic, extraction, and export. These operations are the default for supported formats because they are faster, reproducible, source-anchored, and independently testable.

For example, a case-insensitive search for `avans` across a folder of workbooks must scan canonical cell text and displayed values across every sheet and return file, workbook, sheet, cell, value, and source hash. It must not require the model to discover a parser or write a script.

If a requested transformation cannot be expressed through the supported typed operations, policy may start a fresh code-interpreter microVM. The interpreter receives only explicit read-only inputs, pinned offline libraries, bounded scratch space, typed model mediation, and a structured result contract. Generated code and outputs are audited and verified before presentation or export. See [adr/0015-deterministic-document-tools-and-code-fallback.md](adr/0015-deterministic-document-tools-and-code-fallback.md).

## Minimal First Implementation

The first implementation should include the smallest parser surface that can prove the accounting-style document workflow:

- File inventory, hashing, and manifest creation.
- Native Node extraction for born-digital text-like files, DOCX, spreadsheets, CSV, and email.
- Granite-Docling GGUF adapter for high-value PDFs and layout-sensitive files, with the Docling Python sidecar as escalation.
- Native spreadsheet and CSV adapter for formulas, sheets, cells, typed values, and row windows.
- PaddleOCR-VL adapter only when native or layout extraction is missing or low-confidence.
- MarkItDown adapter for broad first-pass conversion of remaining formats.
- Gemma 4 multimodal inspection only for unresolved page regions.

Do not add a custom parser, custom OCR engine, or custom document database in the first implementation.

## Format-Specific Strategy

### PDF

PDF processing should classify pages:

- Digital text page.
- Scanned page.
- Mixed text and image page.
- Table-heavy page.
- Form page.
- Low-confidence extraction page.

Use native extraction first, layout-aware parsing second, OCR fallback third, and Gemma 4 multimodal inspection only for unresolved page regions. For scanned pages, the OCR path is a specialized document VLM (PaddleOCR-VL class), which as of 2026 outperforms classical OCR pipelines on business documents while fitting the Local 12 memory budget.

### DOCX And Office Documents

Preserve:

- Headings.
- Paragraph order.
- Tables.
- Footnotes.
- Comments where accessible.
- Tracked-change state where accessible.
- Embedded images.
- Source anchors.

Generated outputs should never overwrite the source document without preview, approval, and rollback.

### XLSX And CSV

Spreadsheets require structured parsing.

Preserve:

- Workbook.
- Sheet.
- Cell coordinate.
- Formula.
- Display value.
- Typed value.
- Row and column headers.
- Merged cells.
- Tables and named ranges where available.
- CSV dialect.

Model summaries can describe spreadsheet content, but calculations and reconciliation must be done by deterministic tools.

Exact text search must consider sheet names, cell coordinates, typed and displayed values, formulas where requested, Unicode normalization, case sensitivity, hidden-sheet policy, and merged-cell anchors. Results must identify the precise source cell and workbook hash.

### Huge Documents

Huge documents should be processed as streams or shards:

- Page groups.
- Section groups.
- Sheet chunks.
- Row windows.
- Table regions.
- Attachment groups.

The system should build page and section summaries first, then document summaries, then folder summaries. Large tasks should use the summary tree and targeted retrieval instead of repeatedly rereading raw documents.

The document engine should be able to continue work after model context compaction because canonical document objects, summaries, evidence chunks, warnings, and source anchors live outside the prompt.

See [PERFORMANCE_AND_CONTEXT.md](PERFORMANCE_AND_CONTEXT.md).

## Summary Tree

The summary tree should contain:

- Page summaries.
- Section summaries.
- Table summaries.
- Sheet summaries.
- Document summaries.
- Folder summaries.
- Task-specific summaries.

Every summary node must store:

- Source anchors.
- Generation model profile.
- Prompt version.
- Evidence chunk IDs.
- Confidence or warning flags.
- Verification result.

Summaries are cacheable but must be invalidated when source files change.

## Error Handling

Document processing should surface:

- Unsupported file type.
- Corrupt file.
- Password-protected file.
- OCR failure.
- Spreadsheet formula parse failure.
- Low-confidence table extraction.
- Conflicting parser outputs.
- Missing pages.
- Excessive size.
- Permission denial.

Errors should not silently disappear from final reports.

## Performance Records

Every folder job should record enough timing and memory data to support profile certification:

- Inventory time.
- Parser route per file.
- Parser runtime per file.
- OCR runtime per page where used.
- Embedding runtime per chunk batch.
- Summary runtime per node.
- Peak CPU RAM during document work.
- Peak VRAM if any parser, OCR, embedding, or multimodal step uses GPU.
- Cache hits and misses.
- Resume point after cancellation or failure.
