# ADR 0001: Local-First Product Direction

Created: 2026-07-10

Status: Accepted as product direction

## Context

Vault Desk targets individuals and small professional offices that handle sensitive documents. The market already contains local model launchers and generic RAG tools. Vault Desk needs a stronger promise: useful document work without mandatory cloud dependency.

## Decision

Vault Desk will be local and offline-first.

The product must not include application telemetry, usage analytics, automatic crash reporting, or background metrics export. Local customer-owned audit records stay on the device unless the user explicitly exports them.

The product must not require cloud inference, cloud document upload, or cloud identity for basic operation.

Hosted or hybrid escalation may exist later, but only as an explicit, auditable, user-authorized option.

## Consequences

Positive:

- Strong privacy position.
- Better fit for accounting, legal, and professional offices.
- Clear differentiation from hosted SaaS products.
- Enables appliance and ownership model.

Negative:

- Local model quality and hardware constraints are real limits.
- Updates, support, and diagnostics become more complex.
- Hardware compatibility and performance testing become core product work.
