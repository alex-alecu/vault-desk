# Contributing To Vault Desk

Thank you for helping build Vault Desk. Contributions must preserve the project's local-first privacy model, evidence requirements, approval boundaries, and deliberately small implementation.

## Current Contribution Status

Vault Desk is documentation-only until milestone M0 is explicitly started. The repository does not yet invite implementation pull requests because the Community source license and implementation scaffold have not been established.

Until M0 completes:

- Open an issue to propose an implementation, architecture change, or documentation correction.
- Do not submit application code, manifests, build configuration, scripts, generated assets, or dependency changes.
- Do not treat an unassigned milestone or roadmap item as authorization to implement it.

After M0, implementation issues will be advertised with the `ready-for-contribution` label. Work only from one of those issues or from an issue that a maintainer has explicitly accepted.

## Before Starting

1. Read [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md), which is the authoritative repository instruction file.
2. Read the active milestone in [docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md](docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md).
3. Read [docs/DEVELOPMENT_WORKFLOW.md](docs/DEVELOPMENT_WORKFLOW.md) and the architecture decision records relevant to the change.
4. Confirm that the issue names the product contract, allowed scope, and acceptance evidence.
5. Search the repository and maintained dependencies before proposing new infrastructure.

Security or architecture boundary changes require issue discussion and an accepted or superseding architecture decision record before implementation. A pull request must not silently reopen an accepted boundary.

## Development Workflow

Use a short-lived, focused branch. There is no required branch-name prefix, but the name should identify the change clearly.

Each implementation change follows this sequence:

1. Confirm the active milestone and allowed scope.
2. Inspect existing contracts and research maintained solutions using primary sources.
3. Define the behavior and risk-relevant acceptance evidence before coding.
4. Implement the smallest clear change that passes the gate.
5. Run targeted verification and `pnpm verify`; run a milestone gate only when closing that milestone.
6. Self-review the diff and record remaining risks or an explicit handoff.

Vault Desk does not use a blanket coverage percentage. Tests protect product behavior and invariants identified in [docs/IMPLEMENTATION_QUALITY_BAR.md](docs/IMPLEMENTATION_QUALITY_BAR.md).

## Commit Authorship And DCO

When contributions open after M0, every commit must be authored by the human contributor and certified under the [Developer Certificate of Origin 1.1](https://developercertificate.org/). Add a matching sign-off with:

```text
git commit -s
```

The resulting commit message must include:

```text
Signed-off-by: Your Name <your-email@example.com>
```

Human co-authors may be credited. An AI assistant, model, coding agent, or tool must never be named as an author or co-author, and commit messages and pull request descriptions must not contain generator attribution such as `Generated with ...`.

Use Conventional Commit subjects such as `feat(core): ...`, `fix(parser): ...`, `test(policy): ...`, or `docs(workflow): ...`. Explain why the change is necessary in the body when the subject is not sufficient.

## AI-Assisted Contributions

AI assistance is permitted, but the human contributor remains responsible for every submitted line and claim. The contributor must:

- Understand the change and be able to explain it.
- Verify generated code, documentation, citations, licenses, and commands.
- Prevent customer documents, secrets, private prompts, hidden model reasoning, and employer-owned or proprietary material from entering the repository.
- Report exactly what was verified and what was not.
- Follow the same review and DCO requirements as any other contribution.

AI-generated output never supplies permission, authorship, provenance, or evidence by itself.

## Dependencies And External Material

New or changed dependencies require a written review of:

- Existing in-repository alternatives.
- Maintenance and release posture.
- License, redistribution, notices, and transitive dependencies.
- Offline behavior, telemetry, network requirements, and credential access.
- Package footprint, native components, supported platforms, and supply-chain risk.
- Fit behind the documented adapter boundary.

Use official documentation, registries, source repositories, and license files. Mark behavior or suitability as research-derived until Vault Desk validates it. Do not copy substantial external text or code without preserving the required license and notice.

Never contribute customer documents, confidential data, employer-owned work, private credentials, model files without approved redistribution status, or third-party fixtures without documented rights.

## Pull Requests

Keep each pull request tied to one accepted issue and one milestone-sized responsibility. The pull request must state:

- The active milestone and linked issue.
- What changed and what was intentionally excluded.
- Product and security boundaries touched.
- Exact verification commands and their results.
- Dependency, licensing, offline, telemetry, and packaging impact.
- Remaining risks, failures, or unverified assumptions.

External pull requests require maintainer review. Pull requests use squash merging after required checks and review are complete. Review conversations must be resolved before merge.

## Security Reports

Do not publish vulnerability details in an issue. Follow [.github/SECURITY.md](.github/SECURITY.md) and use GitHub private vulnerability reporting after M0 enables it.
